# Inventory-Management-System-Exploratory-Data-Analysis

This project represents an intricate intersection of supply chain management and data analytics, implemented through MySQL. It was designed to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of stock management in warehouse operations. The data, simulated in Excel, fed into a MySQL database covering various aspects of inventory management

Objectives
The primary goal of this project is to streamline warehouse management processes, including inward and outward stock movements, tracking of deliveries, and monitoring of damaged or expired goods. By leveraging SQL queries, the system facilitates:

Efficient Stock Management: Quick access to total stock, categorized product information, and supplier details.

Data-Driven Decisions: Use of average pricing and order trends to inform procurement and sales strategies.

Enhanced Tracking: Identification of product returns due to expiration, aiding in quality control and inventory rotation

This SQL-based Inventory data analysis stands as a testament to the potential of combining data analytics with supply chain management. It highlights my ability to handle large datasets, execute complex SQL queries, and develop solutions that address real-world business challenges in warehouse and inventory management.
